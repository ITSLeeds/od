Description: The aim of od is to provide tools and example datasets for working with
  origin-destination (OD) datasets of the type used to describe aggregate
  urban mobility patterns (Carey et al. 1981) <doi:10.1287/trsc.15.1.32>.
  The package builds on functions for working with OD data in the package stplanr,
  with a focus on computational efficiency, support for the sf class system
  developed by Pebesma (2018) and ease-of-use.
  With few dependencies, the package should make working with od data and
  developing new functionality straightforward, with od datasets
  based on data frames.
