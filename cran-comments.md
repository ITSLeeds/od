Improved functionality of the points_to_od() function.
Also fixes a CRAN check NOTE.

Note also, we have made a minor change (disag = FALSE by default in od_jitter())
to ensure that the update does not break the abstr package.

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.1.3
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results
