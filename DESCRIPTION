Description: The aim of od is to provide tools and example datasets for working with
  origin-destination (OD) datasets. The package originated as a set of functions in
  the package stplanr for working with origin-destination data but has since 
  evolved to improve computational efficiency, provide new functions
  and updated example data. With minimal dependencies the package also aims to make
  developing new functions for working with od data straighforward, with od datasets
  based on the data.frame class.
