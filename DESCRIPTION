Description: The aim of od is to provide tools and example datasets for working with
  origin-destination (OD) datasets of the type described by
  Nguyen et al. (1988) <doi:10.1016/0191-2615(88)90002-1>.
  The package builds on functions for working with OD data in the package stplanr
  with the aims of improved computational efficiency, greater functionality and
  updated example data. With few dependencies the package also aims to make
  developing new functions for working with od data straighforward, with od datasets
  based on the data.frame class.
