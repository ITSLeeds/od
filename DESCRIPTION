Description: The aim of 'od' is to provide tools and example datasets for
    working with origin-destination ('OD') datasets of the type used to
    describe aggregate urban mobility patterns (Carey et al. 1981)
    <doi:10.1287/trsc.15.1.32>.  The package builds on functions for
    working with 'OD' data in the package 'stplanr', (Lovelace and Ellison
    2018) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2018-053> with a focus on computational
    efficiency and support for the 'sf' class system (Pebesma 2018)
    <doi:10.32614/RJ-2018-009>.  With few dependencies and a simple class
    system based on data frames, the package is intended to facilitate
    efficient analysis of 'OD' datasets and to provide a place for
    developing new functions.  The package enables the creation and
    analysis of geographic entities representing large scale mobility
    patterns, from daily travel between zones in cities to migration
    between countries.
