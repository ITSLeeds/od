Apologies for submitting two versions in quick succession.

The reason is that shortly after submitting version 0.3.0 I realised a minor edge case that would could a downstream package to fail.
I have now fixed this, as documented here: https://github.com/ITSLeeds/od/commit/31b5ce3110424b7897df95e6e144a93f4d11fe7f

Apologies for the inconvenience.
